Problem Statement
Dr. Shakuntala Misra National Rehabilitation University (DSMNRU) face multiple challenges related to communication, information accessibility, and student support. Despite having an official website, students, parents, and visitors often struggle to obtain clear and timely information.

1. Information Scattered Across the Website
Important academic and administrative information such as:


Courses and programs


Fee structure


Admission procedures


Placement details


Campus facilities is spread across multiple web pages.


Users must navigate through several sections to find answers, which is time-consuming                            and confusing.


First-year students and parents often fail to locate correct and updated information.



2. Lack of 24×7 Student Support
University offices and helpdesks operate only during working hours.


Students and parents cannot get answers:


Late at night


On weekends


During holidays or admission rush periods


Urgent queries remain unanswered, leading to stress and dissatisfaction.



3. Repeated Queries to Administration
Administrative staff repeatedly receive the same questions regarding:


Fees and scholarships


Admission process


Cut-offs and eligibility


Contact details and office timings


This repetition:


Increases workload on staff


Delays response time


Reduces efficiency of administrative operations



4. Accessibility Challenges
DSMNRU promotes inclusive education, especially for Divyang (differently-abled) students.


Traditional helpdesks and static websites are not always:


Easy to understand


Accessible


User-friendly for everyone


There is a need for a simple, interactive, and accessible digital solution.



5. No Centralized Digital Helpdesk
There is no single platform where users can:


Ask questions freely


Get instant and accurate responses


Absence of a centralized digital system results in:


Misinformation


Delays


Poor user experience



Proposed Solution: DSMNRU AI College Helpdesk Chatbot
To overcome these challenges, we developed the DSMNRU AI College Helpdesk Chatbot, a smart and interactive web-based assistant designed specifically for DSMNRU.
